# SilentRunner
 
This simple program is used to start a console-application silently (without showing a console window) in Windows OS.\
It can be used, for example, when executing a script within a scheduled task, so that no windows will be opened and annoy the user.

### Program usage
```
SilentRunner.exe "ProgramPath" "ProgramArguments"
```
* _ProgramPath_ - Path of the program to run silently.
* _ProgramArguments_ - Arguments to pass to the program.
